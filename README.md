# Virtual Pet for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

This project is tailored for the [Waveshare 1.44" LCD HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.44inch_LCD_HAT).
It uses the HAT's 128x128 display and built in fiveâ€‘way joystick with
three additional buttons as the sole input and output devices.

The application is written with `pygame` and expects to run directly on
the Pi's framebuffer (`/dev/fb1`).  When launched it will open a full
screen window and listen for GPIO events from the joystick and buttons.

Run the main program with:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Ensure the environment variables `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=fbcon` and
`SDL_FBDEV=/dev/fb1` are available (these are set automatically in
`main.py`).

## Autostart on boot

A `systemd` service file `virtualpet.service` is included so the
application can start automatically when the Pi powers on.

1. Copy the service file to `/etc/systemd/system`:

   ```bash
   sudo cp virtualpet.service /etc/systemd/system/
   ```

2. Edit the `WorkingDirectory` in the file if the repository is located
   somewhere other than `/home/pi/virtualpet`.

3. Enable and start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable virtualpet.service
   sudo systemctl start virtualpet.service
   ```

The application will now run on every boot. View its logs with
`journalctl -u virtualpet.service`.
